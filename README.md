# translator
The language barrier between the communities. Youth these days are very detached from their native/indigenous languages. Our objective is to rupture that barrier. Indigenous languages are often seen as retarded and old. People usually forgets the beauty behind it. 
Our main moto is Todayâ€™s Youth find it comfortable to speak, understand and learn the indigenous languages spoken in various parts of the country.
Our challenge area is KNOWLEDGE so we are trying to make a translator which can be further added to the online chatrooms like Whatsapp, Instagram, Facebook etc. People from different communities can then easily use and understand social media.
